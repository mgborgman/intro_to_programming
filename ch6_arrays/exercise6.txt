Problem: The program is trying to convert a number to a string. names['margaret'] gives the index where the name 'margaret' resides. You are unable to assign an index or Integer object, to a String. 

Solution 1: names[-1] = 'jody'

Solution 2: 
names.index('margaret')
=> 3
names[3] = 'jody'
=> 'jody'
