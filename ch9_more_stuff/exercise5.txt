Why does the following code...

def execute(block)
  block.call
end

execute { puts "Hello from inside the execute method!" }

Give us the following error when we run it?

block.rb1:in `execute': wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)
from test.rb:5:in `<main>'

Answer:

In the definition of the execute function, the block argument should have a '&' in front of it. This means that this function is not equipped to handle blocks, so when execute is called and passed a block as an argument, execute is expecting an argument between '()' not a block. Therefore, you get an exception stating that the funciton was looking for 1 argument, but recieved none.
